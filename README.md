# Library Management System 

## ABSTRACT:

The main objective of Online Library Management System is developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of the library. It has two sides –

1. User side (student / teacher).
2. Admin side.

Only registered users can get every facility of this website. They can log in to their account and see their personal information and modify them. They can search for a book by the name or search it in a particular department. They can easily order a book. After the admin approves it they can see the issue and return date beside the book name. An automatic timer will set up on the user’s id. It’ll show how much time left until the return date. If they need more time they can send a message to the admin. Also, there is a public comment section where registered users can comment on their suggestions and can ask questions.

On the other hand admin can-

* See which student is online right now.
* See all the student information.
* Add new books & delete a book from the list.
* Send a notification to students before their return date and they can also communicate through message.
* Reply in the comment box.

There is a page where all the information of the student is available who has borrowed a book with the return date.

Overall Web-based Library Management System is a project to help the students as well as the staff of the library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also to reduce the human efforts.
